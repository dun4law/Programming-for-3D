This repository contains **Artificial Smiles: Guardian 1 (ASG1)**, a 3D flight combat simulator developed using **Unity 6000.4.0b3** for the Year 3 **G6046: Programming for 3D** Game Design module at the **University of Sussex** in January 2026. The game features realistic flight physics, wave-based combat, and a character-driven dystopian narrative set in Hong Kong's airspace.

This game shares the same character settings, story universe, and some audio/UI design elements from my [final year project](https://github.com/dun4law/Final-Year-Project), as they are both games I created in my final year and are part of the same series. However, the gameplay is completely different.
